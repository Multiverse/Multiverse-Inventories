## About

[Multiverse Inventories](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-inventories) is an add-on Plugin for [Multiverse core](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core) that lets players have separate inventories **per world!** This makes it possible to create multi gamemode servers without Velocity or Bungee!

Now it's time to create your very own server with Multiverse Inventories, do check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/wiki/Home-(Inventories)) and [Usage Guide](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/wiki/Basics-(Inventories)) to get started. Feel free to hop onto our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NZtfKky) if you have any questions or just want to have a chat with us!
